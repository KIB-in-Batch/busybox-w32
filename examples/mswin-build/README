These scripts can be used to cross-compile busybox-w32 on a
Fedora Linux system with mingw-w64 and llvm-mingw toolchains.
The former are available from the Fedora repositories; the
latter needs to be downloaded and installed from:

   https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw

The script should be run from the directory above a git repository
named busybox-w32.  The builds are performed in the directories
named in the TARGETS variable in the scripts.  Previous copies of
these directories are deleted.

The scripts check out the master branch of the git repository.  You
should edit the script if you wish to build from a different commit.

The build time recorded in the executables is the time of the checked
out commit.  This may not result in a perfectly reproducible build
but it's a step in that direction.

The release build performs some additional optimisation and takes
slightly longer as a result.

The busybox-w32 help message includes information about the build
platform.  Obtaining this information is very specific to the
platform used:  you may need to adjust this if building on something
other than Fedora.
